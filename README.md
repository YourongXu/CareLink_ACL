## Problem Statement

Patients recovering from **ACL (Anterior Cruciate Ligament) injuries** often face two major challenges:

1. **Improper rehabilitation posture** may lead to secondary injuries due to misalignment or overextension.
2. **Lack of quantifiable tracking** makes it difficult for both patients and therapists to monitor progress and adjust recovery plans effectively.

These issues can slow down healing, reduce motivation, and increase the risk of long-term joint instability.

## Our Solution

We developed a **smart rehabilitation device** to assist ACL patients during recovery. The device tracks the knee's flexion and alignment angles in real time, provides visual feedback, and suggests safe movement ranges. It also supports users when they try to bend further and acts as a personalized recovery coach.

### Key Features:
- **Real-time Angle Display**  
- **Adaptive Assist Support**  
- **Personalized Goal Coaching**

This solution empowers patients to recover safely, track their progress, and stay motivated throughout the rehabilitation journey.
